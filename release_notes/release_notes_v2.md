# Huawei Solar - PEES

**Power, Energy and Economy Sensors**

## Release Note / v2.2.8

Home Assistant would report the error *"<sensor> is using state class 'total_increasing' which is impossible considering device class ('monetary') it is using; expected None or one of 'total'"* - which seems to be a bug within HA, since none of the sensors or the source sensors has defined state_class to be total_increasing. This update sets the state_class to total for the template trigger sensors in question, to try to mitigate the error report.

## Release Note / v2.2.7

Pull requests implemented:<br>
- #94 "update inverter name sensors to avoid duplicates" by ermitovski 

## Release Note / v2.2.6

Update of the huawei_solar_pees_input.yaml file (version v2.1.5) to automatically fetch the inverter models SUN2000 3.68KTL-L1 and SUN2000 4.6KTL-L1.
Minor refinements and bugfixes.

## Release Note / v2.2.3, v2.2.4 and v2.2.5

Minor refinements and bugfixes.

## Release Note / v2.2.2

#### Limited support for LC0, MAP0, MB0 and iStore products
With this release comes limited support for Huawei inverter models LC0, MAP0 and MB0 and for the corresponding iStore products (the Australian distributor of Huawei). Limited support because I do not have sufficient information about the efficiency of these models (the efficiency graphs). For now, the efficiency calculations are done on basis of the f(x) function used for L1 and M1 respectively.

With this release also the input file and the input card has been revised.

#### Fix for jumping utility meters
Minor corrections has been done to the Energy Yield Sensors and the Energy Utility Meters have been provided with `periodically_resetting: false`.

## Release Note / v2.2.1

#### Add derived sensor

With this release PEES will automatically fetch inverter model and set the rated power accordingly. You need to update all files, *"huawei_solar_pees.yaml"* to v2.2.1, *"huawei_solar_pees_input.yaml"* to v2.0.1 and your Lovelace card with input from *"huawei_solar_pees_input_card.yaml"* v2.0.1.

If you have the *"Huawei Solar STAT package"* running you need to import/update the *"huawei_solar_stat_input"* file.

In *"huawei_solar_pees_input.yaml"* the following sensors / entities have been moved to the *"Huawei Solar STAT package"*.
* `input_number.battery_rated_capacity`
* `input_number.battery_efficiency_soc_triggers`
* `input_number.battery_efficiency_start_value_charge`
* `input_number.battery_efficiency_start_value_discharge`
* `input_number.battery_charge_power`
* `input_number.panels_on_inverter_1`
* `input_number.panels_on_inverter_2`
* `input_number.panels_rated_wp`

In *"huawei_solar_pees_input.yaml"* the following sensors / entities have been discontinued.
* `automation.switch_inverter_1_to_1phase`
* `automation.switch_inverter_1_to_3phase`
* `automation.switch_inverter_2_to_1phase`
* `automation.switch_inverter_2_to_3phase`
* `input_boolean.inverter_1_1phase`
* `input_boolean.inverter_1_3phase`
* `input_boolean.inverter_2_1phase`
* `input_boolean.inverter_2_3phase`
* `input_select.inverter_1_1phase_models`
* `input_select.inverter_1_3phase_models`
* `input_select.inverter_2_1phase_models`
* `input_select.inverter_2_3phase_models`

#### Template trigger sensors

I have got confirmation that the template trigger sensors need an update, so they have now been revised to match "LEGACY SYNTAX".

## Release Note / v2.1.4
It seems that the error message about the "LEGACY SYNTAX" was a bug. Template trigger sensors revered back to previous state.

## Release Note / v2.1.3
Template trigger sensors corrected so they match "LEGACY SYNTAX".

The files `huawei_solar_input.yaml` and `huawei_solar_input_card.yaml` has been renamed to match the name of the package. Input for the STAT package has been deleted (will be available in separate input file for the STAT package). Download the input file for the STAT package if you use it. Consider renaming your PEES input files localy in order to keep your specific user input.

## Release Note / v2.1.2

Economy sensors with "float(0)" would cause unintended jumps for the corresponding utility meter when HA reloaded hence "(0)" has been removed from the following sensors.
* `sensor.economy_result_wo_pv_ts`
* `sensor.economy_expenses_w_pv_ts`
* `sensor.economy_income_w_pv_ts`
* `sensor.economy_result_w_pv_ts`
* `sensor.economy_nri_pv_ts`
* `sensor.economy_nri_battery_ts`
  
In the `huawei_solar_input.yaml` file "- service:" used in the 4 automations "Switch Inverter Between Phases" has been replaced with "-action:" according to revised HA documentation.

## Release Note / v2.1.0 and v2.1.1

According to the current version (version 1.4.1) of the *"Huawei Solar Integration"* by wlcrs, the naming of the input sensor `sensor.battery_charge_discharge_power` has been converted to `sensor.batteries_charge_discharge_power`. There is no changes to the names provided by the *"Huawei Solar PEES package"*.
  
Input number for the Battery Charge Power has been added to the *"huawei_solar_input.yaml"* file.

Release v2.1.1 created due to release error.

## Release Note / v2.0.7

Support for the newly released *"Huawei Solar STAT package"*, including new weekly utility meters in the `huawei_solar_pees.yaml` file and minor changes to the "Input Card". No changes were made to the `huawei_solar_input.yaml` file.

## Release Note / v2.0.6

No changes made. GitHub issues / Procedure failiure.

## Release Note / v2.0.5

### Issues

* Issue with utility meter jumping at restart and reboot fixed. This issue especially conserns the economy utility meters. The fix includes rolling back the new sensors introduced in v2.0.0.

### Sensors Removed

The following sensors introdiced in version v2.0.0 are being removed as they were intended to solve the issue described above.

* `sensor.battery_charge_yield_sale_ts`
* `sensor.battery_charge_grid_cost_ts`
* `sensor.battery_discharge_grid_sale_ts`
* `sensor.battery_discharge_house_saving_ts`

### Documentation

The README is up to date with the latest changes. The Wiki Pages are under revision due to these changes.

## Release Note / v2.0.1, v2.0.2, v2.0.3 and v2.0.4

Minor changes to Energy Yield Total (ts).<br>
Correcting branch and version. 

## Release Note / v2.0.0

The *"Huawei Solar PEES package file"* has been upgraded to version 2.0.0 and with this leap comes interaction via the GUI the ability to save most of your user specific settings and the possibility to the efficiency corrected power input sensor without the need for any copy/pasting.

### The package

The *"Huawei Solar PEES package"* now includes 3 files - 1) the `huawei_solar_pees.yaml` file that contain all the custom sensors included in the *"Huawei Solar PEES package"*, 2) the `huawei_solar_input.yaml` file that contain sensors for your user specific solar PV settings, and 3) the `huawei_solar_input_card.md` file that contains the code for the Lovelace card / GUI interface.

> :bulb: The *"Huawei Solar PEES package"* will work "out of the box". You do not have to use/setup the user specific settings and the Lovelace card. But you have to copy both `yaml` files into you package folder/directory for the custom sensors to work.

### Efficiency Corrected Input Power

Previusly you had to copy/paste the efficiency corrected input power sensor input the `huawei_solar_pees.yaml` file and delete the default power sensor. The efficiency corrected input power sensor is now "activated" via the two boolean switches on the Lovelace card, where you also choose the number of phases your inverter has.

From here you  will now be presented with a drop down menu where you choose your specific inverter model.

Below the drop down menu with the inverter models you wil have two sliders, one to control the operating voltage and one to control the overall factor. The README explain what these slides do / how they effect the power input.

> :bulb: If you do not want the efficiency corrected sensor you just leave the two boolean switches off.

### Electricity Price Sensor

The Lovelace card also includes a text box, where it is now possible to add your choice of electricity price sensors. Just ad the sensor name and the calculations will be based on your specific electricity price sensor. The folowing sensors have been added.

* `sensor.electricity_price_import_ts`
* `sensor.electricity_price_export_ts`

<br>

> :bulb: The electricity price sensors (with sensor names according to the README) from the *"Energi Data Service integration"* are used as default sensors.

### New Economy Sensors

To address [issue #29](https://github.com/JensenNick/huawei_solar_pees/issues/29) with the late start up of some of the economy sensors, it has been necessary to add a few template sensors in order to set an availibility on them individualy. To my knowledge it is a bit unorthodox to create a template sensor based on a utility meter, but none the less it solves the issue. The new template sensors are,

* `sensor.battery_charge_yield_sale_ts`
* `sensor.battery_charge_grid_cost_ts`
* `sensor.battery_discharge_grid_sale_ts`
* `sensor.battery_discharge_house_saving_ts`

### New Energy Sensoors

In the same manner the same principal sollution has been used to improve setup procedure for those with a single inverter setup. Sensor `sensor.energy_yield_total_ts` will now be active without the need to manually set `sensor.energy_yield_2_ts` to 0 (zero). The new template sensors are,

* `sensor.energy_yield_1_ts`
* `sensor.energy_yield_2_ts`

### Unique ID on All Utility Meters

All utility meters have now been provided with a `unique_id` which alow you to edit the precision and the icon in the GUI.
